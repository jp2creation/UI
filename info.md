# UI-Lovelace-Minimalist

It's kind of hard to explain what this is, so let's call it a "theme" (in quotation marks). But one thing is for sure, it is very nice! Taking the exceptional work of tben as a basis, this repository is aimed to ease installation and maintainance of his wonderful work. You can use this interpretation of a SmartHomeUI more or less like a theme in HomeAssistant.
